Cookie Clicker Reflection

What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Writing out each step and seeing the browser update in real time helped the most. Selecting elements with `getElementById()` and then updating `textContent` gave me instant feedback, which made everything click.

How did you choose your milestone messages?
I tried to make them fun and encouraging, like mini achievements that reward the user’s persistence. I added emojis to match the playful cookie theme.

What challenge or bug surprised you?
I forgot to change the background color with each message at first. I realized the DOM change worked, but the styling didn’t update because I hadn't targeted the body element directly.

What personal twist did you add?
I made the app feel more “me” by calling it the “Nikki Edition,” changing the background color at each milestone, and customizing the messages with emojis.

What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Many mobile games and fitness apps use this type of click-to-track interaction. Apps like Duolingo or Habitica reward users for small repetitive actions, which keeps people engaged.
